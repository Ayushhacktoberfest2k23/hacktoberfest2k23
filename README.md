Welcome to the Hacktoberfest repository! I am currently accepting pull requests and merging them into the main branch. However, please note that there are currently conflicts in the repository, so we will not be merging any pull requests until all conflicts are resolved. 

Hacktoberfest is a beginner-friendly project designed to help you get started with your Hacktoberfest journey. This repository too is beginner-friendly where you will find fun while the deeper you dig to solve the issue or crack the problem.

### Getting Started

To contribute to this repository, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository (button on top)
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone `
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Hacktoberfest2023`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-new-branch`

### Avoiding Conflicts (Syncing your fork)

To avoid conflicts, you can add an 'upstream' for your git repository, as other pull requests may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

To add an upstream remote, use the following command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2023`

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing: `git remote -v`

To pull any new changes from the parent repository, run: `git merge upstream/master`. This will allow you to easily solve any conflicts in your repository. It's a good idea to use this command frequently in between your own commits to ensure your repository is up to date with its parent.

For more information on syncing forks, you can read this article from GitHub: [Syncing a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
